# Solidity Smart Contracts Start

This is a practice ground for a beginners Solidity course. The repo is designed to help me, and you maybe, get first hands-on experience with Solidity and smart contract development using Hardhat.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repo and install the necessary dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/codebatine/Solidity-Smart-Contracts-Start.git
cd Solidity-Smart-Contracts-Start
npm install
```

## How to Use This Repo

1. **Explore the `contracts/` folder**: This is where all the Solidity files are. Start by checking out the examples and then try building your own.

2. **Run the scripts**: Head over to the `scripts/` folder to see deployment scripts. You can modify these to deploy your contracts on a local Hardhat network.

3. **Test your contracts**: In the `tests/` folder, you'll find test cases. Run them with Hardhat to make sure everything is working:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

4. **Experiment and Learn**: Feel free to experiment with the contracts, scripts and tests.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Hardhat**: This project uses Hardhat as the development environment. You can install it globally with:

```
npm install --global hardhat
```
